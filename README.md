# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my practice code for learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.  
I am using IntelliJ IDEA for coding the basics and building my own implementations.

## What's inside
- **Linked List** 
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Array**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Hash table**
- **Heap**
- **Graph**
- **Threads**
- **ReentrantLock**
- **Synchronization**
- **WaitNotify**
- **ConcurrentHashMap**
- **Tree Traversal**

## Why this repo exists
I created this to practice the fundamentals of DSA by writing code from scratch.  
These are not optimized library solutions, but my own implementations to understand how each data structure works internally.
