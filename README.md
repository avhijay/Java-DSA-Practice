# Java DSA Practice

This project contains my practice work for core DSA ,Java concepts, 
algorithms, and concurrency. The repository includes implementations, examples,
and small demonstrations for each topic.

## What's inside
### Data Structures and Algorithms

ArraysExamples
BinarySearchTree
DoublyLinkedList
Graph
HashTable
Heap
LinkedList
Queue
Stack
StringOperations

### Concurrency and Multithreading

MyThread
BlockingQueueExample
BlockingQueueMethodsExample
ConcurrentHashMapExample
ConcurrentLinkedQueueExample
ReentrantLockExample
SynchronizationExample
WaitNotifyExample

## Why this repo exists
I created this to practice the fundamentals of DSA by writing code from scratch.  
These are not optimized library solutions, but my own implementations to understand how each data structure works internally.
